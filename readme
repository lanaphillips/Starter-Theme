# WordPress HTML5 Starter Theme

## Summary

This is a blank WordPress theme inspired by the HTML5 Reset Template. I felt that the HTML5 Reset Template markup was almost a little too bare and didn't include the basic role tags as specified in the Accessibility Project (http://a11yproject.com/). I also added post/page thumbnail support by default, with a "has-figure/no-figure" class for easy styling.

I also tried to be as meticulous as possible and adhere to WordPress theme coding standards (http://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/coding-standards/).
